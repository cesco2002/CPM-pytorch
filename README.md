# Parameter Optimization of Stochastic lattice models

In each of the four .ipynb "REPORT" files shown in this repository, you can see the code used to make the plots of my thesis's final report. In particular, for each model, 3 plots were shown:

-  the trend of the spread of the disease
-  the results of the parameter estimation experiments, testing for 3 different (pairs/triplets) parameters
-  the trend of the loss function, aggregated per epoch

In addition, I decided to keep in the repository three code snippets that, for me, were of vital importance towards the correct implementation of the SI model. These notebook files can be found in "discrete and-or stoch" directory.
In here, 3 files can be found, each of them refers to toy examples implemented at the early stages of this project. I decided to leave them thinking they can help a reader understand the techniques of 

1.  Straight-Through-Estimator
2.  Reparametrization
3.  Gumbel-Softmax trick
